# Unity Compute Shader Samples

I keep forgetting how to setup compute shaders in Unity and keep searching sample code from my previous projects. This is a collection of code that I keep coming back to bind Render Textures or Structured Buffers. There are currently 3 samples:



#### Basic Setup

I  remember first time creating a compute shader and not knowing what to do with it. This sample shows how to create and bind a render texture to compute shader and to render it.



#### Particle Instancing

An example to position points in a compute shader and render them procedurally.



#### 2D Particle Trail

An example of manipulating a render texture in every frame. Particles are moved in each frame and leave a trail.



I hope these samples will help someone!
